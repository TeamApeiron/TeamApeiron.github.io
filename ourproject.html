        <h2 id="slogan"> SIM Supported Smart Vehicle System </h2>
        <h2 id="ozet"> In second-hand vehicle sales, illegal changes 
          (reducing the total mileage of the vehicle, changing the 
          accident report, etc.) are made about the information of the 
          vehicle with certain methods. For this reason, buyers suffer.
           According to TUIK's data in 2020, 83% of car accidents are 
           caused by drivers. In addition, since the emergency numbers 
           are notified late in serious accidents, the necessary 
           interventions cannot be made in a timely manner, and this 
           delay creates major problems. Accidents may occur due to the
            fact that the drivers are asleep or the speed limits and 
            traffic rules are not taken into account in places where 
            inspections are not made frequently. The main purpose of 
            the implementation of this project is to increase the
             reliability and honesty of sales in vehicles, to speed up 
             communication in emergency situations, to reduce the 
             damage caused by the vehicle to the ecosystem, and to 
             ensure a healthy journey of drivers and passengers. In the
              event of an accident, the location of the vehicle will be
               sent to the 112 Emergency Line and predetermined persons
               , and a call will be made. In addition, thanks to the SIM
                card to be placed in the vehicles, it will be possible
                 to control the vehicle while driving. Rule violations 
                 such as exceeding the speed limit and obeying traffic 
                 lights will be examined. With the eye tracking system
                  installed in the vehicle, it will be possible to 
                  observe whether the driver is asleep or not. Scoring 
                  will be made by looking at criminal records, damage
                  to ecological balance, tracking system and speed control information. Thus, it is aimed to increase the percentage of drivers complying with the rules and to provide some advantages to drivers with high vehicle scores. By defining a SIM Card to the vehicle and providing Google maps integration, graphic formation, score calculation and other features listed above will be implemented.
          In the literature review, no developed example of the device
           that monitors the odometers electronically and prevents the 
           victimization caused by changes was not found. For this 
           reason, the idea of the electronic mileage tracking device
            in the project is innovative in its field. A system that
             scores the vehicles according to the speed limit and 
             criminal record and takes various measures accordingly 
             has not been encountered. For this reason, the sim card 
             supported vehicle tracking system is also innovative in 
             its field. A similar project has been found to make 
             emergency calls in vehicles, but informing the emergency 
             line according to the deployment status of the airbag has
              given our idea a different perspective.</h2>
